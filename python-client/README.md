## Usage

### Installation

Install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/assign-uprn/)

``` sh
$ pip install assign-uprn
```

### Background

#### Algorithmic address-to-UPRN matching

> The algorithm, known as ASSIGN (**A**ddre**SS** Match**I**n**G** to
> Unique Property Reference **N**umbers) allocates a Unique Property
> Reference Number (UPRN) to records containing addresses.

> Every property in the UK already has a UPRN. They are allocated by
> local authorities and made nationally available by Ordnance Survey. A
> UPRN gives every address a standardised format, enabling pseudonymised
> linkage to other sources of data.

> ASSIGN compares addresses in freetext form with the Ordnance Survey’s
> “AddressBase Premium” UPRN database, one element at a time, and
> decides whether there is a match. The algorithm mirrors human pattern
> recognition, so it allows for certain character swaps, spelling
> mistakes and abbreviations. After rigorous testing and adjustments,
> ASSIGN correctly matched 98.6% of patient addresses at 38,000 records
> per minute.

#### UPRN de-identification

ASSIGN can also de-identify UPRNs into Residential Anonymised Linkage
Fields (RALFs).

RALFs are locations that are pseudo-anonymised by encrypting them using
a salt which has itself been encrypted by a research governance function
using the openpseudonymiser website:

> <https://www.openpseudonymiser.org>

Different datasets containing UPRNs, such as datasets from across public
services bring combined as part of a research project, can be
de-identified using a shared project salt, and then linked anonymously
for research purposes by anonymising the UPRN of each datapoint into a
RALF.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### A note on re-identification
>
> De-identified data protects information about individuals within a
> safe environment, such as the safe settings element of the five safes
> framework:
>
> > <https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/secure-lab/what-is-the-five-safes-framework/>
>
> Still, should the information leave that environment, it can then be
> re-identified through links with other datasets. This possibility is
> explained in the following excerpt by Cory Doctorow:
>
> > <https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/08/the-fire-of-orodruin/>
>
> > …it is surprisingly easy to “re-identify” individuals in anonymous
> > data-sets. To take an obvious example: we know which two dates
> > former PM Tony Blair was given a specific treatment for a cardiac
> > emergency, because this happened while he was in office. We also
> > know Blair’s date of birth. Check any trove of NHS data that records
> > a person who matches those three facts and you’ve found Tony Blair –
> > and all the private data contained alongside those public facts is
> > now in the public domain, forever.
>
> > Not everyone has Tony Blair’s reidentification hooks, but everyone
> > has data in some kind of database, and those databases are
> > continually being breached, leaked or intentionally released. A
> > breach from a taxi service like Addison-Lee or Uber, or from
> > Transport for London, will reveal the journeys that immediately
> > preceded each prescription at each clinic or hospital in an
> > “anonymous” NHS dataset, which can then be cross-referenced to
> > databases of home addresses and workplaces. In an eyeblink, millions
> > of Britons’ records of receiving treatment for STIs or cancer can be
> > connected with named individuals – again, forever.
>
> Using de-identified UPRNs in datasets does not eliminate the danger of
> person-level records being re-identified. For this reason, an
> alternative research data management practice is now being using by
> organisations such as OpenSAFELY:
>
> > <https://www.opensafely.org>
>
> OpenSAFELY retains records in a secure location following the safe
> settings principle of the five safes where it remains unseen, even in
> de-identified form. Instead, researchers prepare their analysis code
> on synthetic data.
>
> Researchers also prepare outputs to be disclosure controlled and
> submit their code to moderation within OpenSAFELY, where it is run
> against the unseen data.
>
> The disclosure controls are checked by moderators prior to release,
> and only data that cannot be re-identified is shared.

## Pre-requirements

### License to use AddressBase Premium

AddressBase Premium usage is typically used by public service providers
under the terms of the Public Services Geospatial Mapping Agreement
(PSGA). You can check whether you are licensed to use this datas with
the following lookup:

> <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/psga-member-finder>

### API access and authentication

Endeavour health manage access, and provide the API endpoints,
usernames, and passwords that support API usage:

> <https://endeavourhealth.org>

### Python packages used by this module

the following packages dependencies need to be available in the python
environment used by this package

``` py
# pip install requests, used to interact with the API
import requests
```

``` py
# pip install python-dotenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

#### Working with python-dotenv

Create a `.env` file in the project root containing the following
variables used by the package:

``` sh
# ASSIGN_ENDPOINT may be something like:
# https://server-root-address/uprnapi/api2
ASSIGN_ENDPOINT=api_url
ASSIGN_USER=your_username
ASSIGN_PASS=your_password
```

`.env` is explicitly excluded from version control by `.gitignore` and
keeps your authentication credentials separate from the code, making it
safer and easier to share your work.

### De-identification salt (optional)

To obtain RALFs, your research governance function can support you to
obtain a salt they have previously encrypted with the openpseudonymiser
website using a salt phrase created for the research project being
conducted:

> <https://www.openpseudonymiser.org>

The salt is encrypted using a private key known only to the University
of Nottingham (the maintainers of openpseudonymiser).

## Using the API

### Single address check

A single address can be sent for matching within a single HTTP request.
A search for `10+Downing+St,Westminster,London,SW1A2AA` would receive
the following response:

``` json
{
   "Address_format":"good",
   "Postcode_quality":"good",
   "Matched":true,
   "BestMatch":{
      "UPRN":"100023336956",
      "Qualifier":"Property",
      "LogicalStatus":"1",
      "Classification":"RD04",
      "ClassTerm":"Terraced",
      "Algorithm":"10-match1",
      "ABPAddress":{
         "Number":"10",
         "Street":"Downing Street",
         "Town":"City Of Westminster",
         "Postcode":"SW1A 2AA"
      },
      "Match_pattern":{
         "Postcode":"equivalent",
         "Street":"equivalent",
         "Number":"equivalent",
         "Building":"equivalent",
         "Flat":"equivalent"
      }
   }
}
```

### Uploading an encrypted salt

If you wish to de-identify the UPRNs, please ask your data governance
function to provide you with a `.EncryptedSalt` file from the
openpseudonymiser website. You can then use this packages
[`upload`](https://joeldn.srht.site/assign-uprn/api_calls.html#upload)
function to send this to the API.

Subsequent addresses sent to the API with the
[`upload`](https://joeldn.srht.site/assign-uprn/api_calls.html#upload)
function will not only be UPRN matched, but a RALF will be provided too
(see the `ralf` column in `Example download file content` in this
document).

### Multiple address checking

Multiple addresses can be uploaded within a text file which is processed
immediately after the file has been uploaded, and downloaded shortly
afterwards.

### Upload

The maximum number of address candidates that you can upload in a single
file is `100,000`.

The address file to be uploaded must:

- have a .txt extension
- include no headers
- contain two columns separated by a single tab character
  - The first line must not contain any header information
  - The first column is a unique numeric row id
  - The second column is the address (with commas between each address
    line)

#### Example upload file content:

``` tsv
1⭾10 Downing St,Westminster,London,SW1A2AA
3⭾Bridge Street,London,SW1A 2LW
4⭾221b Baker St,Marylebone,London,NW1 6XE
5⭾3 Abbey Rd,St John's Wood,London,NW8 9AY
```

### Download

Uploads are processed straightaway and can be downloaded by referencing
the name of the upload file in the API call. The download includes data
from AddressBase Premium (plus a RALF if you’ve previously uploaded a
`.EncryptedSalt` file):

## Developer Guide

This project uses `nbdev` which uses notebooks to create the package the
module, tests, documentation (using quarto), and makes git versioning
cleaner by removing notebook metadata prior to commits:

> <https://nbdev.fast.ai/>

### Working on the assign-uprn package

nbdev provides a number of commands supporting development work on a
version-controlled package, test, and documentation portfolio.

Some of the commands used during a typical development workflow are
listed below:

``` sh
# install assign_uprn as editable source code
$ pip install -e '[.dev]'

# make changes to notebooks in the nbs/ directory
# ...

# remove notebook metadata to make git history cleaner
$ nbdev_clean

# compile to have changes apply to assign_uprn module, and run tests
$ nbdev_prepare

# build the static website with quarto (https://quarto.org/)
$ nbdev_docs

# local preview of the website with quarto
$ nbdev_preview
```
